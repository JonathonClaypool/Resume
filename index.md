## MAJOR PROJECTS AS PRIMARY LEAD
#### Personal emergency response Dashboard and Backend (2017+)
Call center representatives receiving emergency calls via the Reemo solution would navigate to the dashboard for real
time wearer updates. UI implemented in Angular 5, while backend implemented using Java spring. Required heavy
interfacing with the monitoring companies’ systems, as well as 3rd party APIs for latest jurisdictional emergency
information.
#### Personal Emergency Response (PERS) Handling Service (2017)
Architected and implemented a Personal Emergency message handling service to integrate with partner APIs.
Microservice architecture allowing it to scale efficiently and painlessly, while emphasizing reliability. Makes heavy use of
azure cloud infrastructure.
#### Reemo Tizen Build Server (2016)
A backend utility to automate build packages for Reemo with continuous integration. Involved scripting and research
into the inner workings of Tizen’s project manifest and structure. Required deeper investigation of the Tizen compilation
process, and the tizen cli certificate signature process. The technology is bleeding edge and not as widely adopted, so
reference material is scarce.
#### Reemo Android app (2016)
Responsible for the construction and maintenance of the Reemo Android Application. Hands on, drinking from the
firehose experience. Usage of newer android application frameworks such as dagger dependency injection.
#### Orthographic RogueLike (2016+)
Creation of a tile based adventure game similar to the classic Rogue. Uses different algorithms including A* pathfinding
Lighting, and behavioral algorithms, as well as procedural map generation.
#### League of Legends Draft App (2014)
A web based application using Meteor that allows users to determine which champion to play. Makes use of Riot
Games API calls to gather data.
